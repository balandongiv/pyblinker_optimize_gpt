Below is an example of how you might refactor these functions for slightly better efficiency and readability while preserving:

All existing function names and signatures (in case they are called externally).
All docstrings and return values.
The same overall logic of the original code.
Ability to be used in a pandas.DataFrame.apply(...) context, should you map them onto columns.
The main improvements focus on:

Using local variables to reduce repeated lookups (e.g., storing slices of candidateSignal in local arrays).
Minimizing repeated calls to NumPy functions that can be computed once.
Slightly more “Pythonic” structure (for example, checking array sizes before slicing).
Keeping docstrings, comments, and return values exactly as in the original code so nothing breaks downstream.
